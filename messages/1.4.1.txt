SublimeLinter-contrib-lslint
-------------------------------
v1.4.1

Push all fixes I forgot to release. The linter should work again.

- Added requirement for SublimeLinter3. It will be pulled automatically.
  Sublime Linter 4 DOES NOT WORK!

**Warning!!! To fix the plugin I had to create a dependency for sublimeLinter3. I do not know how this behaves with SublimeLinter4 installed.**

A thousand apologies for the overdue release.
